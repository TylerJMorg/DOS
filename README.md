## Abstract
This standard outlines how digital and physical documents, informative information, folders/folios, booklets, cards, vaults, and any other important documents are to be filed and organized. This system is primarily designed for individuals in the United States but can be modified to fit the needs of individuals in other countries.

It is imperative that average individuals have the knowledge to easily access their important documents on-demand while still keeping their information in secure locations using state-of-the-art technology. This standard outlines the security and consistency of document organizing for easy access while keeping physical and online threats at a minimum.
